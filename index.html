For my project proposal, I would like to make a neural network that can predict the outcome of a tennis match between two professional tennis players. This model would be trained on previous match data to be able to predict who wins certain matches. The part of this project that will be difficult will be finding enough data that is compatible with the model, as well as fitting said data to the model in a way that allows for the model not to be overfit to the data but can still still make accurate predictions. After having both played and watched tennis for my entire life, I think it would be interesting to create a program that is able to somewhat accruately predict results based on various conditions that can affect a match.

Goals:
<ul>
 <li> Have the model be at least 70% accurate.</li>
 <li>Find data that goes back to at least 2005.</li>
 <li>Have the model work based on different conditions (court surface, country match is played in, etc.)</li>
</ul>
